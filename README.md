Library to add documents on firebase Store-

This is library is for uploading document in your firebase storage.

Step by Step guide to use this Library into your project is as follows-

1.	Download the library AAR file from the following link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18uxGcYDox4gBVzaMYgGZC7YxopoOQy-V?usp=sharing.

2.	Now add the aar file in libs folder in your project. Go to project/ app/libs.

3.	Now add the google services and the dir location of the aar file in build.gradle.
 
4.	Now add the following line of code in build.gradle.app.
    implementation 'com.firebaseui:firebase-ui-firestore:6.3.0'
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:23.0.3'
    implementation 'com.firebaseui:firebase-ui-auth:6.3.0'
    implementation 'com.firebaseui:firebase-ui-storage:6.3.0'
    implementation(name:'invoidLibrary', ext:'aar')
    And also add google service at bottom.
    apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'

5.	Now wherever you want to call the library add this line of code.
   Intent intent=new Intent(AddDetails.this, UploadDocumentActivity.class);
   startActivity(intent);

6.	Also donâ€™t forget to connect your firebase to your application.

7.	Once the uploading is completing and get the url of the location add this line of code wherever required.
    SharedPreferences mySharedPreferences = getSharedPreferences("URLLINK", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
    imageUrl = mySharedPreferences.getString("URL", "");

8.	You are Good to go.

Note- There are easy ways to add a library but in the task it was mentioned to add it from AAR file so I have used it.

9.	You can check the code of the example application where this library is used. The link is as follows-
